      <p>The best way to learn about using Apache POI is to read through the <a href="index.html">feature documentation</a>
          and other online examples online.
      </p>
      <p>To keep the features documentation focused on the APIs, there is little mention of some of the configuration
          settings that can be enabled that may prove useful to users who have to handle very large documents or very
          large throughput.
      </p>

          <td>POI support for XSSF APIs relies heavily on <a href="https://xmlbeans.apache.org">XMLBeans</a>.
            This instance can be <a href="https://xmlbeans.apache.org/docs/5.0.0/org/apache/xmlbeans/XmlOptions.html">configured</a>.
            It is recommended to take care if you do change any of the config items.
            In POI 5.1.0, we will disallow Doc Type parsing in the XML files embedded in xlsx/docx/pptx/etc files, by default.
            DEFAULT_XML_OPTIONS.setDisallowDocTypeDeclaration(false) will undo this change.

          <td>Sets the ratio between de- and inflated bytes to detect zipbomb.
              It defaults to 1% (= 0.01d), i.e. when the compression is better than 1% for any given read package part, the parsing will fail indicating a Zip-Bomb.

            This can be used to limit memory consumption and protect against security vulnerabilities when documents are provided by users.
            POI 5.1.0 removes the previous limit of 4GB on this setting.

            This can be used to limit memory consumption and protect against security vulnerabilities when documents are provided by users.
            The default is approx 10 million chars. Prior to POI 5.1.0, the max allowed was approx 4 billion chars.

            Number of bytes at which a zip entry is regarded as too large for holding in memory
            and the data is put in a temp file instead - defaults to -1 meaning temp files are not used
            and that zip entries with more than 2GB of data after decompressing will fail, 0 means all
            zip entries are stored in temp files. A threshold like 50000000 (approx 50Mb is recommended)
